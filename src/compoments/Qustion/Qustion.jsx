                            In React, both props and state are used to manage data in a
                            component, but they serve different purposes. Props short for
                            properties are read-only data that are passed to a component from
                            its parent component. They are used to configure and customize a
                            component. When a parent component passes props to its child
                            component, those props are available as a parameter in the child
                            component's function definition. Props cannot be modified within
                            the component, they are fixed and cannot change during the
                            component's life cycle. On the other hand, state is a mutable data
                            that are managed within a component. It represents the internal
                            state of a component and can change during the component's life
                            cycle. State can only be changed using the setState() function,
                            which is provided by React and should be used to update the state
                            in a way that React can properly manage.

                            React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently render changes to the UI.
                            When a component's state or props change, React creates a new
                            virtual DOM tree, compares it with the previous tree, and
                            calculates the minimum number of changes required to update the
                            actual DOM. Then it updates the actual DOM with the changes. React
                            also provides features for managing state, handling events, and
                            working with server-side data.

                            useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a
                            functional component. It returns an array with two values: the
                            current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an
                            initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state
                            value whenever the setter function is called. Every time your
                            component renders, useState gives you an array containing two
                            values: The state variable counter with the value you stored.
                            The state setter function setCounter which can update the state
                            variable and trigger React to render the component again.

                            The useEffect hook in React is used for performing side effects in
                            function components. This includes not only fetching data, but
                            also other actions such as setting up event listeners, updating
                            the document title, or managing animations. It allows you to run
                            code after the component has rendered or when certain dependencies
                            have changed, and is useful for integrating with external
                            libraries or managing complex state in your application.
